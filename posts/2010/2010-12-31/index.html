    <p>So I guess of all the days of the year, new years eve is probably the most appropriate for a blog posting and well I guess I just wanna write down all this year and leave it behind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Year started on a high point, Quite literally. The Austrian Alps snowboarding, amazing start to the year. Broken wrist on January 2nd however was clearly a missed omen for things to come. The year started well, uni was fun everything was gravy.</li>
<li>Next big event was of course my 21st. An amazing surprise party thrown by my flatmate’s and friends followed by an epic round of pub golf. Best birthday ever.</li>
<li>Nothing really else happened until the start of summer where life took a turn for the worst.Said bye to all the flat mates for summer and came home.</li>
<li>Trip to Heathrow airport. Emotional but all smiles. The beginning of the end.</li>
<li>Holiday trip to Newquay with the lads, quality week – same time next year.</li>
<li>Not great summer otherwise for undisclosed reasons. (Others follow)</li>
<li>Learnt over summer how to rebuild a car.</li>
<li>Learnt over summer the feeling of wasted effort.</li>
<li>2000 mile flight to nearly make the biggest mistake of my life very wasted journey.</li>
<li>Get home, border-line breakdown. Start of £400+ month of boozing.</li>
<li>Confirmed partially deaf on one side and “Stressed”.</li>
<li>Back to university, continuation of boozy month based around bad decisions and probably just as bad morals. Felt good.</li>
<li>Did stupid things: regret one, ignored others and some will be done again.</li>
<li>First semester hard work still due to health issues and personal problems.</li>
<li>Uni Crimbos really good days and proof I can make cake.</li>
<li>Scraped some essays together and came home for Xmas.</li>
<li>Crimo overall non-event. Family and self ill over season, worked and didn’t drink enough. New work boots and games though.</li>
<li>Grand-dads 80th. Quality day and good to see all the family again.</li>
<li>New years eve… Going to wash this whole year away.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all I can honestly say, due to one thing or another 2010 has been the worst year of my life to date and I hope 2011 is so much better. However I did learn to never take a back seat in your own life, make mistakes, be a screw up and just live because at the end of the day, if you don’t then your dead. And that’s just quitting.</p>
<p>When it gets to 2011 I know a lot of memories, places and people will be in 2010 and for some of them, as far as I’m concerned they can stay there.</p>
<p>Heres to 2011…</p>
