    <p>So, as some of you may have seen, I absolutely loved this film. I’m not really sure what it was about it but it was totally awesome. Possibly the best so far.<br>
Potential Spoilers Follow!!<br>
##The Story##<br>
So the story is that Dom Toretto(Vin Diesel) and Brian O’Connor (Paul Walker) have been running from the different law agencies and wind up meeting on a job organised by Vince (TF&amp;TF). The job goes south as they invariably steal a car with very important content from one of Rios biggest gangster bosses.</p>
<p>As the gangster boss sends countless lackeys after the crew to regain his cargo, the team also have to contend with a new specialist agent, Hobbs (Dwanyne Johnson) assigned to bring Toretto and O’Connor in. When the team finally find out the importance of the stolen cargo, they plan one last blow out job which will require all their expertise and those of their past acquaintances. Enter Rome and Tej (2F2F), Han (TD, F&amp;F) and Gisele, Leo and Santos (F&amp;F). They all form a Fast and Furious dream team to pull of the job with an even cut each, but in doing so they all become wanted and targets for Hobbs. The job holds many twists and turns follows through to a surprising outcome.</p>
<p>##The Characters##<br>
The characters are all the same as they have been in the previous films in the franchise. Thankfully they are all still played by the same cast and so the characters hold their same mannerisms. Johnson as Hobbs is a welcome addition to the cast bringing a bit of humour again, and looks to be joining the franchise for more than just this outing.</p>
<p>##Summary##<br>
The film is a massive contrast to that of Fast and Furious which was quite heavy and serious in nature whereas Rio Heist has returned to the older style of off handed comments and jokes (especially from Hobbs and Rome) and also in places just plain silliness. I guess in summary I really loved the film because of this. It united all the cast in a way that actually worked, it had a good story which was deep in places but it also returned the far-fetched and plain silly edge that we have all come to expect and love in the Fast and Furious films.</p>
