    <p class="card-text">
    <p>The other evening a good friend of mine turned to me and asked <em>“How is it that you are so ready to leave Bangor so easily?”</em> to which my immediate answer was <em>“I’m only thinking about leaving the city of Bangor, not it’s people and my friends. It’s easier like that.”</em> It was a very true answer, I haven’t even considered the social aspect of it all and have just been focused on the fact that the city of Bangor has lost its magic for me. I’m one of those people that needs to move from place to place or constantly be doing something otherwise I get bored and suffer cabin fever really quickly. Bangor as a city has that feeling now, it’s lost it’s edge and its appeal of being somewhere new and exciting. So it’s time for me to move on..<br>
That said, I have slowly been moving out since Xmas but today I decided to take a break from revision and ended up packing up more stuff into plain white boxes. It all felt fine as I was sorting the stuff and loading it up but then I took a step back and saw basically three years worth of life in boxes against the wall. That’s when I had to take a breather as photos and cards stacked up. It made me realize that I’d been telling myself that this would be an easy task for the past few weeks, finding excuses to shift out as quick as possible to soften the blow but truth be told this is probably going to be one of the most emotionally draining times of my life to date.</p>
<p>I’ll be even more honest and say I’m totally dreading it all. In all honesty, I don’t handle good byes and see you soon’s all that well, I get a bit down when it comes to the summer break knowing I wont see people for a few months and this is something wholly different! I guess it doesn’t help that I never properly left school or sixth form with everyone else for one reason or another. Another thing I really don’t like is the whole lot being summed up into one particular event. One day or night that marks a big full-stop really does make me choke a bit. I guess that’s another reason I’m not overly fond on the idea of going to the ball this year as it would provide that exact finish and that’s scary. Really Scary.</p>
<p>In hindsight Bangor I’ve had some of the best years of my life here in Bangor. Sure there were up’s and down’s but that’s life. As I head away from the place, I’ll be leaving having learnt so many things, had loads of fun experiences and most importantly knowing that I’ve met some really great people over the time and hoping that those bonds of friendship don’t change as the setting does..</p>
