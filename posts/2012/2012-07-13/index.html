    <p>The end of another week, another spell of rough weather and damp clothes but it wasn‚Äôt all doom and gloom. We continued to excavate the roundhouse from last year in trench two having finally finished uncovering it at the beginning of the week. Then for the middle of the week I was moved down to the local Reconstruction and community site at Felin Uchaf, (well worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area.) where I the wet sieving system was set up to process soil samples from all three seasons of the excavation to date.</p>
<!-- exchange -->
<p>This was quite a cool experience as I‚Äôve never done it before so it was nice to learn something new again, especially as I even got to process some of the sample that I took last year. One from a hearth was expressly interesting though heavily clayed so hard work! Another sample had become infested by ants and their eggs made the whole thing a little creepy crawly under the skin but otherwise it was all OK.</p>
<p>Whilst at the centre, after the success of my work with the school groups of last year I was again roped in to help with the visiting schools. This once again consisted of burying some ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù into the sand pit and then letting the groups excavate and record them. This was good fun and it was nice to actually seen some teenage kids interested in what they were doing. Another bonus was that we then got to join the groups for hand-made pizzas at lunch üôÇ</p>
<p>That is about all that I really have to report for the week. Off for a weekend back in Bangor to get nicely rested and freshened up, see you same time next week.<br>
